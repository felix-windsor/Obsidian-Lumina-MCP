MCP TypeScript SDK
Important

This is the main branch which contains v2 of the SDK (currently in development, pre-alpha).

We anticipate a stable v2 release in Q1 2026. Until then, v1.x remains the recommended version for production use. v1.x will continue to receive bug fixes and security updates for at least 6 months after v2 ships to give people time to upgrade.

For v1 documentation and code, see the v1.x branch.

Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows applications to provide context for LLMs in a standardized way, separating the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction.

This repository contains the TypeScript SDK implementation of the MCP specification and ships:

MCP server libraries (tools/resources/prompts, Streamable HTTP, stdio, auth helpers)
MCP client libraries (transports, high-level helpers, OAuth helpers)
Runnable examples (under examples/)
Packages
This monorepo publishes split packages:

@modelcontextprotocol/server: build MCP servers
@modelcontextprotocol/client: build MCP clients
Both packages have a required peer dependency on zod for schema validation. The SDK internally imports from zod/v4, but remains compatible with projects using Zod v3.25+.

Installation
Server
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server zod
Client
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/client zod
Quick Start (runnable examples)
The runnable examples live under examples/ and are kept in sync with the docs.

Install dependencies (from repo root):
pnpm install
Run a Streamable HTTP example server:
pnpm --filter @modelcontextprotocol/examples-server exec tsx src/simpleStreamableHttp.ts
Alternatively, from within the example package:

cd examples/server
pnpm tsx src/simpleStreamableHttp.ts
Run the interactive client in another terminal:
pnpm --filter @modelcontextprotocol/examples-client exec tsx src/simpleStreamableHttp.ts
Alternatively, from within the example package:

cd examples/client
pnpm tsx src/simpleStreamableHttp.ts

v1 (legacy) documentation and fixes
